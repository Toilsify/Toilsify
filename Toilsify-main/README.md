### Hi there ğŸ‘‹


Welcome to Toilsify (https://toilsify.com)

ğŸ”­ We are currently creating a solution that allows users to find public toilets around them. 

ğŸŒ± We are using web technologies that will simplify human living and promoting SDG GOALS (https://www.google.com/search?client=opera&q=sdg+goals+list&sourceid=opera&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8).

ğŸ‘¯ We are looking to collaborate with other open-source developers to add more features to this web app.

ğŸ’¬ You can reach out to us on github about any [issues](https://github.com/Toilsify/Toilsify/issues)

âš¡ Fun fact: This idea was generated in a toilet.. ğŸ˜‚
